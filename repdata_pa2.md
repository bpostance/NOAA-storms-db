# Analysis of NOAA's Storm Events Database: Preparing for Severe Weather Events

## Synopsis
This document provides an analysis of U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) [Storm Events Database](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/) in order to address the question of which major weather events are most harmful with respect to population health and/or have the greatest economic consequences. It's the result of the second assignment from the Coursera's Reproducible Research online course.

## Data files

The main data file used in this analysis is a 47Mb comma-separated-value file compressed via the bzip2 algorithm that can be [downloaded](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) from the course web site.

Additionally, we've used two more files that allowed us to 1) map inconsistent event type descriptions to the limited list of 48 event types, as defined in NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS) Directive 10-1605 and 2) adjust economic damages for inflation.
